# Introduction 
LogicApps are quick to get up and running and are really easy to stitch together services.  But, they can also be a little challenging.  My goal is to provide some sample projects for examples and guidance.  Mostly, this is for my personal reference, but hope someone else finds it useful.

# Examples and Guidance
Just starting, so the content is pretty sparce at the moment.  Probably the number one question/request I get from customers is how to move a Logic through a Ci/Cd process, so I am going to build that out first.

## [DevOps](DevOps/README.md)
* Demonstrate working with LogicApp Parameters
* Demonstrate parameterizing connections
* Demonstrate Automatically Authorizing a connection
* Demonstrate Ci/Cd with GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines
